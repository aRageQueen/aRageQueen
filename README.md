- 👋 Hi, I’m @aRageQueen
- 👀 I’m interested in adversary research, medical device attack surface management, MMORPGs, pixelart, homemade breads, and plants!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GO, C#, .NET, and dusting off old programming knowledge in Python, Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fraud mitigation strategies, healthcare security, open-source intelligence automation, and cute mini-games.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun facts: salsa dancer, amateur horticulturist, LOTR enthusiast, will destroy anyone at Killing Floor 2
